## Installation

First step is to install all necessary dependencies :

```bash
  npm install
```

Now route the command to create all database tables :

```bash
  npm run migrate
```

Now just start the API :

```bash
  npm start
```
## API documentation

- The purpose of this api is to create film notes containing the description, title, a note for that film and a tag that is the style of the film, such as action, adventure, etc..
- I recommend using a DBMS to monitor the creation of data, I recommend beekeeper but it is not mandatory;
- If you install beekeeper, it is very easy to use, just choose the sqlite option and then navigate to the src/database/database.db file;
- You will need a tool for API testing and debugging, I recommend imsomnia;

### Users route

```http
  POST /localhost:3333/users

 {
	"name": "Your name",
	"email": "Your email",
